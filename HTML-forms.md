## HTML Forms

To create an HTML form you need to use the `<form>` tag. The HTML `<form>` element defines a form that is used to collect user input. The tag `<form>` has the following attributes: 

* action - specifies the program we send our request to
* method - the method we use - GET|POST

The tag `<input>` is used to specify the areas for the user input. The `<input>` tag has the following attributes:

* name - the name of the field,
* value - the value of the field,
* type - the type of input:
    * text - a small text field
    * textarea - a big text field
    * checkbox - chackbox buttons
    * radio - radio buttons (only one of those can be selected)
    * submit - the submit to the server button

## Final project guidelines

A project is a homework that you design for yourself. Ideally, your project should help you with your linguistic research outside of the course.

Some suggestions:

* a web-application for a linguistic experiment
* a web-application for collecting fieldwork data
* a program that downloads some data from the web, preprocesses it and visualizes it
* a program that draws graphs of for a couple of different semantic fields in a couple of languages
